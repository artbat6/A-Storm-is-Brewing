# A Storm is Brewing

This is a brewery finder that lists breweries and weather for a particular city based on a user's search.  We wanted to create something that would be useful to a user to know the weather for a particular city they may be traveling to that same day.  It has a search history that saves the user's searches in local storage for convenient recall.   

## Installation

Follow this link and begin searching for breweries in different cities.
